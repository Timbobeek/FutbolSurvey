Idea:

Home Page has a start survey button
Survey has questions in a window with text to be entered or multiple choice
Once entered and submit button pressed, you are either automatically or manually switched to next question
When done, big thank you message

At all times, there is a "see other people response' button, where all the data is kept at (on a separate page)

! you can only edit/delete your own entry
