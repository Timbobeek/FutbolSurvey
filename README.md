Idea:

Home Page has a start survey button
Survey has questions in a window with text to be entered or multiple choice
Once entered and submit button pressed, you are either automatically or manually switched to next question
When done, big thank you message

At all times, there is a "see other people response' button, where all the data is kept at (on a separate page)

! you can only edit/delete your own entry 

---------------------------TO DO LIST------------------------------

-need to create the database to keep all the answers at

-are all questions be displayed or by clicking next button, one at a time?

-Once you sign in, what page do you see? 

-What happens once you answer all of the question and hit submit? 

-need to make a POST that is triggered onClick of submit button

-removal/editing only of items with a specific name (so users can't edit others' entries)
